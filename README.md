<h1 align="center">ERIC : AI based desktop assistant</h1>

The project aims to develop a personal assistant for windows-based systems. The inspiration for ‚ÄúERIC‚Äù is drawn from virtual assistants like Cortana for windows and Siri for IOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands.

The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. Speech Recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. In Python there is an API called Speech Recognition which allows us to convert speech into text. It was an interesting task to make our own assistant. It became easier to send WhatsApp messages without typing any word, searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your favourite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies is such that they can perform any task with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us.

Some basic facilities of the project are as follows:

1.	It can send WhatsApp messages.
2.	It can open desktop apps like command prompt, notepad, adobe acrobat or any code editor, etc.
3.	It can play music on YouTube.
4.	It can search on Wikipedia and speak the results as well.
5.	It can open websites like Google, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and others in your web browser.
6.	It can control the system volume using your voice commands.
7.	It can open web camera, download Instagram profile photo and take screenshots.
8.	It can tell the laptop‚Äôs battery percentage.
9.	It can tell the user‚Äôs IP address.
10.	It can fetch the latest news.
11.	It can shut down, restart and sleep the system.
12.	It can tell the temperature of a city, set timers and tell the internet speed.
